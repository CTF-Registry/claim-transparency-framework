# Claim Transparency Framework (CTF)

## Purpose
The Claim Transparency Framework (CTF) is a declarative transparency framework designed to structure, classify, and document unverified claims without validation, endorsement, arbitration, or moral judgment.

CTF exists to reduce ambiguity and implicit responsibility in environments where claims cannot be conclusively proven or disproven.

## What CTF Is
- A neutral declaration layer for public claims
- A procedural structure for claim classification and limitation
- A non-judicial, non-enforcing transparency framework
- A responsibility attribution mechanism

## What CTF Is Not
- A certification or approval system
- A truth or fact-checking authority
- A legitimacy or credibility label
- A moderation or enforcement tool
- A consumer protection guarantee

## Core Principles
- Declarative only (no assertions about reality)
- Non-legitimation (no endorsement implied)
- Responsibility remains with the declarant
- No arbitration, scoring, or ranking
- Single canonical specification

## Intended Use
CTF is intended for platforms, operators, practitioners, and institutions seeking to:
- clarify the scope and limits of claims,
- reduce implicit endorsement risk,
- improve transparency and traceability of declared responsibility.

Adoption of CTF is voluntary and non-binding.

## Governance and Evolution
CTF operates without central authority or personal governance.
Evolution follows a formal, impersonal RFC-style compatibility process.
Core invariants are immutable.

## Disclaimer
CTF makes no claims regarding truth, effectiveness, safety, legality, or legitimacy of any declared practice or belief.
Use of the framework does not imply endorsement or approval.
