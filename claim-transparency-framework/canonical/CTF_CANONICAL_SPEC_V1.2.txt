CTF is an open, declarative transparency framework.

CTF does not validate, judge, certify, endorse, or legitimize any claim, practice, belief, method, or individual.

CTF provides a procedural structure for claim declaration, classification, and transparency only.

No authority, moral position, or truth assessment is implied.

The only authoritative documents are those explicitly listed in this canonical specification.
