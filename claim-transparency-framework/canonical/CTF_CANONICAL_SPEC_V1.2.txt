Claim Transparency Framework (CTF)
Canonical Specification — Version 1.2
Status: Frozen
Date: 2026-01-28

CTF is an open, declarative transparency framework.

CTF does not validate, judge, certify, endorse, or legitimize any claim, practice, belief, method, or individual.

CTF provides a procedural structure for claim declaration, classification, and transparency only.

No authority, moral position, or truth assessment is implied.

The only authoritative documents are those explicitly listed in this canonical specification.

References to spiritual, belief-based, metaphysical or non-verifiable practices are used solely as illustrative examples.

The Claim Transparency Framework applies equally to any domain involving unverifiable, contextual, probabilistic, automated or non-falsifiable claims.
