CLAIM TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK
Governance and Update Policy
Version 1.0

Purpose
This document defines how the Claim Transparency Framework (CTF) is maintained, updated, and governed over time.
Its objective is to ensure stability, neutrality, and continuity, while allowing controlled evolution.

—

1. Governance Principles

The governance of the CTF is based on the following principles:
- neutrality
- non-endorsement
- non-capture
- continuity
- minimal authority

The CTF is not governed by belief systems, industries, practitioners, or platforms.

—

2. Absence of Central Authority

The CTF does not rely on a single individual, founder, or spokesperson.
Governance functions are procedural, not personal.

No individual has unilateral authority to modify the framework.

—

3. Governance Body (Framework Stewardship Group)

The CTF may be overseen by a stewardship group responsible for:
- maintaining documentation
- managing version updates
- ensuring internal consistency
- publishing clarifications when needed

The stewardship group does not evaluate claims, practices, or individuals.

—

4. Independence and Conflict of Interest

Members involved in stewardship activities must:
- disclose potential conflicts of interest
- refrain from participating in decisions where conflicts exist

Governance roles do not grant influence over claim classification or platform decisions.

—

5. Update Principles

Updates to the CTF must adhere to the following constraints:
- backward compatibility where possible
- no retroactive modification of past declarations
- no introduction of validation, certification, or scoring
- preservation of neutrality

—

6. Versioning

Each update results in a new framework version.
Versions are publicly documented and timestamped.

Deprecated elements remain documented for reference.

—

7. Amendment Triggers

Amendments may be initiated due to:
- operational feedback
- platform requirements
- legal or regulatory developments
- identified ambiguities

Amendments are not initiated to respond to ideological or reputational pressure.

—

8. Public Consultation (Optional)

The stewardship group may open limited public consultation for specific clarifications.
Consultation does not imply voting or consensus-based governance.

—

9. Stability Commitment

The CTF prioritizes stability over rapid iteration.
Frequent changes are avoided to preserve trust and adoption.

—

10. Dissolution or Forking

In the event that stewardship becomes compromised or inactive:
- the framework documentation remains accessible
- third parties may fork the framework under the same principles
