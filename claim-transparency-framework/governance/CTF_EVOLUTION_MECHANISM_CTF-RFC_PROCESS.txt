CLAIM TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK (CTF)
EVOLUTION MECHANISM — CTF-RFC PROCESS (CANONICAL TEXT)
ARTICLE I — PURPOSE OF THE EVOLUTION MECHANISM

The purpose of the CTF evolution mechanism is to allow controlled, predictable, and compatible evolution of the framework without requiring subjective judgment, ideological arbitration, or personal authority.

Evolution exists to:

extend applicability,

refine structure,

preserve coherence at scale,

ensure long-term viability.

Evolution does not exist to:

reinterpret core principles,

adapt the framework to beliefs,

validate practices,

respond to pressure or popularity.

ARTICLE II — RFC PRINCIPLE
2.1 Definition

Any proposed change, extension, or addition to the CTF shall be submitted as a CTF-RFC (Claim Transparency Framework — Request for Compatibility).

A CTF-RFC is a formal compatibility proposal, not a request for approval.

2.2 Scope of RFCs

RFCs may apply to:

sectoral modules,

structural clarifications,

technical interfaces,

documentation refinements,

tooling compatibility layers.

RFCs may not apply to:

Core Invariants,

constitutional principles,

responsibility attribution rules,

non-assertiveness constraints.

ARTICLE III — RFC FORMAT (MANDATORY)

Each CTF-RFC must strictly follow the canonical format below.

3.1 RFC Metadata

RFC Identifier

Date of submission

Target CTF version

RFC category (module / clarification / interface)

Backward compatibility statement

3.2 Description

Objective description of the proposed extension

Explicit scope of applicability

Explicit non-scope (what it does not cover)

3.3 Compatibility Analysis

Demonstration of compatibility with all Core Invariants

Confirmation of non-assertiveness

Confirmation of non-legitimation

3.4 Impact Declaration

Expected procedural impact

Affected components (if any)

No evaluation of outcomes or effectiveness permitted

3.5 Formal Compliance Statement

A signed statement declaring full compliance with the Constitution and Core Invariants.

ARTICLE IV — ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

An RFC is eligible for consideration only if all of the following conditions are met:

Full RFC format compliance

Explicit compatibility with all Core Invariants

No implicit or explicit validation of claims

No introduction of scoring, ranking, or judgment

Clear separation between declaration and interpretation

Failure to meet any criterion results in automatic rejection.

ARTICLE V — ADOPTION MECHANISM
5.1 Adoption by measurable thresholds

RFC adoption is not based on approval, voting, or authority.

An RFC becomes Active only when predefined measurable thresholds are met, such as:

number of independent implementations,

number of registry usages,

documented compatibility integrations.

Thresholds are defined per RFC category and published in advance.

5.2 Automatic activation

Once thresholds are met:

the RFC status changes automatically to Active,

the RFC becomes part of the canonical specification,

a new minor or major version is issued.

No discretionary intervention is permitted.

ARTICLE VI — VERSIONING RULES
6.1 Version structure

CTF versions follow semantic versioning:

Major version: structural changes

Minor version: compatible extensions

Patch version: clarifications only

6.2 Backward compatibility

Backward compatibility is mandatory unless explicitly declared and justified in the RFC metadata.

ARTICLE VII — REJECTION AND REVOCATION
7.1 Automatic rejection

An RFC is automatically rejected if:

it violates any Core Invariant,

it introduces implicit assertions,

it attempts to legitimize claims,

it conflicts with the Constitution.

7.2 Automatic revocation

An adopted RFC may be revoked automatically if:

incompatibility is demonstrated,

formal non-compliance is detected,

documented misuse becomes systemic.

Revocation is procedural and does not imply fault or judgment.

ARTICLE VIII — ROLE OF MAINTAINERS
8.1 Limited procedural role

Maintainers may:

verify formal compliance,

verify threshold metrics,

publish versions.

Maintainers may not:

interpret intent,

evaluate usefulness,

accelerate or block adoption.

ARTICLE IX — FINAL PROVISION

The RFC mechanism is the sole authorized method for evolving the Claim Transparency Framework.

Any modification outside this process is null and incompatible with CTF.
