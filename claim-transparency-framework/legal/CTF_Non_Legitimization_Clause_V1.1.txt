Non-Legitimization Clause

Use of the Claim Transparency Framework (CTF), including registration of a claim or reference to the framework, does not imply legitimacy, credibility, trustworthiness, effectiveness, safety, or ethical standing of any practice or practitioner.

The CTF provides structured transparency only.
It does not confer status, approval, or recognition of merit.

This clause applies to all uses of the CTF, including public display, platform integration, and third-party references.
