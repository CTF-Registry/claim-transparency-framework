CLAIM TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK
Global Disclaimer
Version 1.0

The Claim Transparency Framework (CTF) is a neutral, declarative framework designed to document claims related to non-conventional practices.

The CTF does not:
- determine the truth or falsity of any claim
- evaluate effectiveness, safety, or outcomes
- validate, certify, endorse, or approve any practice or practitioner
- provide medical, legal, financial, scientific, or professional advice

All claims recorded within the CTF are declared by practitioners under their sole responsibility.

The presence of a claim within the CTF Registry does not imply:
- accuracy
- reliability
- endorsement
- suitability for any individual or context

Users, platforms, and third parties remain fully responsible for:
- their interpretation of CTF declarations
- decisions made based on such information
- compliance with applicable laws and regulations

The CTF serves solely as a transparency and documentation framework.
Use of the framework is voluntary and non-binding.

Non-Legitimization Clause

Use of the Claim Transparency Framework (CTF), including registration of a claim or reference to the framework, does not imply legitimacy, credibility, trustworthiness, effectiveness, safety, or ethical standing of any practice or practitioner.

The CTF provides structured transparency only.
It does not confer status, approval, or recognition of merit.

This clause applies to all uses of the CTF, including public display, platform integration, and third-party references.
