CLAIM TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK
Platform Compatibility Rules
Version 1.0

Purpose
These rules define how declared claims within the CTF may be displayed, contextualized, restricted, or declined by hosting platforms.
They do not impose decisions, but provide a structured basis for platform-level risk management.

—

1. Principle of Platform Sovereignty

Platforms retain full authority over their own policies, moderation rules, and content decisions.
The CTF does not override, replace, or challenge platform governance.

—

2. Compatibility Is Contextual, Not Absolute

A claim may be:
- compatible with one platform
- restricted on another
- declined on a third

Compatibility depends on platform-specific risk tolerance, audience, and legal environment.

—

3. Display Categories

Platforms may classify claims into one of the following display modes:

3.1 Full Display  
The claim is displayed with its full CTF declaration.

3.2 Contextual Display  
The claim is displayed with additional contextual information (e.g., validation level, limitations, disclaimers).

3.3 Restricted Display  
The claim is accessible but not promoted, recommended, or monetized.

3.4 Declined Display  
The claim is not displayed on the platform.

—

4. Validation Level Guidance (Non-Binding)

The following guidance is indicative and non-mandatory:

- Level 0–1 claims are generally low-risk for display.
- Level 2 claims may require contextual display.
- Level 3 claims may require explicit conditions and limitations.
- Level 4 claims may require additional scrutiny depending on the platform.

The CTF does not mandate enforcement.

—

5. Universality and Reproducibility Claims

Claims asserting universality or guaranteed reproducibility may be flagged by platforms for:
- additional review
- restricted display
- or refusal

Such decisions are platform-specific.

—

6. Inconsistency Notices

Platforms may consider documented inconsistency notices when assessing compatibility.
The presence of an inconsistency notice does not imply falsity.

—

7. Non-Liability of the Framework

The CTF bears no liability for platform decisions, claim content, or user outcomes.

—

8. Audit and Review

Platforms may periodically review compatibility decisions based on:
- policy changes
- legal developments
- updated claim versions
