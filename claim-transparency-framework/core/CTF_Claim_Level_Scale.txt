THE CLAIM TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK
The Claim Level Scale — Official Definition (V1.0)


LEVEL 0 — Symbolic / Spiritual Meaning

Symbolic narratives

Spiritual interpretation

Personal meaning-making

What this level forbids

Claims of effect on health, emotions, behavior, or reality

Testimonials presented as evidence

Any form of reproducibility claim


LEVEL 1 — Subjective Personal Experience

Definition

The practice claims subjective effects experienced by the practitioner or the client, without asserting generalizability or external causality.

What this level allows

Personal sensations

Emotional or introspective experiences

Individual perceptions

What this level forbids

Claims of consistent outcomes across individuals

Phrases implying guaranteed transformation

Functional or physical causality


LEVEL 2 — Experiential / Testimonial-Based

Definition

The practice claims effects reported by multiple clients through testimonials or feedback, without asserting reproducibility or controlled conditions.

What this level allows

Client testimonials

Aggregated feedback

Recurrent reported experiences

What this level forbids

Claims of systematic effectiveness

Statements implying reliability “for everyone”

Undefined escalation toward reproducibility


LEVEL 3 — Reproducible Under Specific Conditions

Definition

The practice claims reproducible effects under explicitly defined and limited conditions.

Mandatory requirements

Explicit conditions (context, practitioner, protocol)

Clear scope of reproducibility

Acknowledgment of failure cases

What this level forbids

Claims of universality

Reproducibility without constraints

Ambiguous or shifting conditions


LEVEL 4 — Experimental Demonstration Claimed

Definition

The practice claims demonstrable effects observable through controlled or repeatable experimental setups.

Mandatory requirements

Defined demonstration protocol

Clear separation between claim and interpretation

Acceptance of external scrutiny


CRITICAL SYSTEM RULE

The higher the level, the higher the burden of coherence, limitation, and accountability.

WHAT THIS SCALE ACHIEVES

It prevents level inflation

It forces practitioners to self-position

It gives platforms objective thresholds

It keeps the framework neutral

The CTF does not ask “Is it true?”
It asks “What exactly are you claiming, and at what cost?”
