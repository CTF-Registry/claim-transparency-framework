CLAIM TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK
Public Neutrality Charter
Version 1.0

PREAMBLE
The Claim Transparency Framework (CTF) was created to address a structural gap in how non-conventional claims are presented, interpreted, and managed in public and digital spaces.

This framework does not seek to regulate belief, judge practices, or arbitrate truth.
It exists to enable clarity, responsibility, and traceability where ambiguity creates risk.

1. CORE POSITION
The CTF is a neutral declarative framework.
It does not evaluate the truth, validity, effectiveness, or legitimacy of any practice or belief.

Its sole function is to structure how claims are declared and contextualized.

2. NEUTRALITY PRINCIPLE
The CTF does not favor or oppose:
- any belief system
- any spiritual, symbolic, intuitive, or experiential practice
- any scientific or non-scientific worldview

The framework applies identically to all declared claims, regardless of cultural, philosophical, or spiritual context.

3. NON-JUDICIAL NATURE
The CTF is not a court, regulator, or certification body.
It does not issue rulings, sanctions, or approvals.

All decisions regarding use, moderation, or visibility of content remain the responsibility of third parties (platforms, organizers, users).

4. RESPONSIBILITY CLARIFICATION
The CTF affirms a simple principle:
Responsibility for a claim belongs to the party that declares it.

The framework exists to make this responsibility explicit, visible, and traceable over time.

5. TRANSPARENCY OVER TRUTH
The CTF prioritizes transparency over truth determination.
It recognizes that many domains cannot be conclusively proven or disproven, yet still require clear communication.

The framework enables informed interpretation without enforcing belief or disbelief.

6. UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY
The CTF is designed to be:
- culturally neutral
- jurisdiction-agnostic
- compatible with diverse legal and ethical environments

It may be adopted voluntarily by platforms, practitioners, and institutions worldwide.

7. NO ENDORSEMENT
Use of the CTF does not imply endorsement, certification, or validation of any claim or practice.

The presence of a Claim Declaration Sheet indicates transparency, not legitimacy.

8. EVOLUTION & STABILITY
The framework may evolve to improve clarity and usability.
Core principles of neutrality, non-judgment, and responsibility attribution are immutable.

9. FINAL STATEMENT
The Claim Transparency Framework exists to reduce harm created by ambiguity,
without restricting belief,
without enforcing ideology,
and without claiming authority over truth.

It is a language of declaration, not a verdict.
