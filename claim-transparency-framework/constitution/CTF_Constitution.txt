CLAIM TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK (CTF)
CONSTITUTION — VERSION 1.0 (CANONICAL TEXT)
PREAMBLE

The Claim Transparency Framework (CTF) is a procedural standard designed to structure, document, and trace public claims without asserting their truth, validity, effectiveness, or legitimacy.

CTF exists to clarify responsibility, scope, and limits of claims in environments where ambiguity generates risk, conflict, or misinterpretation.

CTF does not evaluate reality.
CTF documents declarations.

ARTICLE I — PURPOSE
1.1 Purpose of CTF

The sole purpose of CTF is to provide a neutral, structured, and reproducible method for declaring claims.

CTF exists to:

make implicit claims explicit,

associate claims with clear responsibility,

define scope and limitations of claims,

enable procedural handling of ambiguity.

1.2 Absence of evaluative function

CTF shall never:

validate claims,

invalidate claims,

certify practices,

assess effectiveness,

judge belief systems,

determine truth or falsity.

ARTICLE II — NATURE OF THE FRAMEWORK
2.1 Declarative-only standard

CTF is strictly declarative.
It operates exclusively on what is claimed, not on what is.

2.2 Non-normative position

CTF does not impose:

moral standards,

ethical judgments,

scientific criteria,

cultural interpretations.

2.3 Procedural neutrality

CTF treats all claims identically, regardless of:

domain,

popularity,

controversy,

social acceptance.

ARTICLE III — CORE INVARIANTS (NON-MODIFIABLE)

The following principles are absolute invariants and shall never be modified, overridden, or bypassed:

Non-assertiveness
CTF makes no assertions about reality.

Non-legitimation
Use of CTF does not imply endorsement or credibility.

Responsibility Attribution
Every claim remains fully attributable to its declarant.

No Arbitration of Substance
CTF never arbitrates content, meaning, or outcome.

Single Canonical Specification
Only one official version of the CTF specification exists at any time.

ARTICLE IV — WHAT CTF IS NOT

CTF is not:

a certification system,

a regulatory authority,

a truth verification mechanism,

a consumer protection label,

a dispute resolution system,

a governance of practices.

Any representation of CTF as such constitutes misuse.

ARTICLE V — SCOPE OF THE CORE STANDARD
5.1 Core standard definition

The CTF core standard is limited to:

claim structure,

claim categorization,

declaration levels,

explicit non-claims,

versioning and traceability.

5.2 Sector neutrality

The core standard is sector-agnostic and shall not embed domain-specific assumptions.

ARTICLE VI — ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

The following actions are strictly prohibited:

assigning scores or ratings to claims,

ranking claims by credibility,

issuing approvals or rejections of claims,

representing CTF usage as proof of validity,

modifying declarations without declarant attribution.

Any system or operator performing these actions is incompatible with CTF.

ARTICLE VII — INTERPRETATION RULES
7.1 Literal interpretation

All CTF texts, declarations, and specifications shall be interpreted literally and procedurally.

7.2 No implied meaning

No implied, inferred, or contextual meaning shall be attributed beyond what is explicitly declared.

ARTICLE VIII — GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLE
8.1 Non-personal governance

CTF governance is non-personal and non-charismatic.

Authority resides exclusively in:

this Constitution,

the canonical specification,

the procedural rules of evolution.

8.2 Role of maintainers

Maintainers may:

ensure textual coherence,

enforce compatibility rules,

publish versions.

Maintainers may not:

judge claims,

interpret intent,

modify invariants.

ARTICLE IX — EVOLUTION FRAMEWORK
9.1 Controlled evolution

CTF may evolve only through formally defined extension mechanisms.

9.2 Invariant protection

No evolution mechanism may alter or bypass the Core Invariants defined in Article III.

9.3 Compatibility requirement

All extensions must remain fully compatible with the core standard.

ARTICLE X — FINAL PROVISION

This Constitution is the highest authority of the Claim Transparency Framework.

Any conflict between this Constitution and any other document, module, or implementation shall be resolved in favor of this Constitution.
